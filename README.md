# ShortShieldPack
「Shield blocking your view? Then use this.」

![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124531500/216846879-65318f5e-9f97-4906-8347-83c10435ad74.png)

# Contents
- Textures that "only" make shields smaller
       
~~I actually just tweaked the shield models.~~

# Way to use something
- Just bump the file into resourcepacks.

### About Supported Versions
- In the meantime, it should work for all versions with shields.    
└ Between you and me, I made it to work with 1.16.5 or later, but for some reason it also worked with 1.12.2.     
  That's why I put "In the meantime" on it.
  
# Other
- Feel free to distribute secondarily.
- No problem to distribute the file in a separate texture
